# Smelly pack

**This pack doesn't work yet. Check back later :)**

Blocked on getting compiled pack to load in a version of Minecraft. "At least one of your behavior packs failed to load" in Minecraft Preview 1.19.40.21 after running `npm run compile "Chat Ranks","Chat Ranks" "Chat Ranks" 5.0.2` and moving the compiled `.mcpack` to `...\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\behavior_packs`, adding behavior pack (the only custom behavior pack) to the world, and joining world. Typing in chat just shows regular chat instead of chat ranks.

This add-on uses the [Smelly API v1](https://github.com/Smelly-API/Smelly-API/commit/562efb3453932901c304aaefd531d17999eb6c56) to add JavaScript logic. This unlocks advanced add-on features, I think :D

The pack was created by me following [Smell of Curry](https://github.com/smell-of-curry)'s [YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJqDT8CClc). The first commit copies the Smelly API v3 code.

## Smelly API

This is a wrapper for the MCBE Gamtest Framework, which uses advanced ways to make it easy for all beginners to learn Minecraft's Gamtest Framework and JavaScript. With this wrapper, you can create projects that will inspire, build, and change Minecraft forever. The Smelly API wraps around the gametest framework, making it easier to use and also implementing some key functions for bedrock development.
