# Smelly pack

This add-on uses the Smelly API to add JavaScript logic. This unlocks advanced features, I think :D

The pack was created by me following [Smell of Curry](https://github.com/smell-of-curry)'s [YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJqDT8CClc). The first commit copies the Smelly API v3 code.

## Smelly API

This is a wrapper for the MCBE Gamtest Framework, which uses advanced ways to make it easy for all beginners to learn Minecraft's Gamtest Framework and JavaScript. With this wrapper, you can create projects that will inspire, build, and change Minecraft forever. The Smelly API wraps around the gametest framework, making it easier to use and also implementing some key functions for bedrock development.
