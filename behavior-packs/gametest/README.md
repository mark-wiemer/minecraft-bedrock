## Running the tests

Follow the steps at the [official `minecraft-gametests` sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-gametests#using-these-behavior-packs)

### Troubleshooting

When in doubt, restart Minecraft: close it entirely and start it again. Sometimes parts of the mods update by simply leaving and re-joining the world, but restarting the game is the best bet.
