# Inventory Management

Solving the age-old problem, Necesse-style :)

## Continuous workflow

This project is also my first significant Minecraft Bedrock add-on, so a lot of work will be going into project management. That means setting up a continuous workflow with automated file linting, unit tests, and integration tests. It'll also mean setting up PRs and build actions and GitHub projects and all that other fun stuff. So bear with me if progress is slow at the beginning -- I'm laying a foundation upon which everyone can build awesome Minecraft add-ons!
