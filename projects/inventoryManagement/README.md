## Template

`__todo__` replace this readme with a description of your project!

This isn't a project. It's a template for a project that uses TypeScript!

These files are adapted from the [official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptinggettingstarted#getting-started)).

## Get started with project development

Do these steps once for your computer, that's it!

1. Install `NodeJS`, which comes with `npm`.
1. Optionally, install `VSCode` for easy development.

## Project initialization steps

Do these steps every time you want to create a new add-on:

1. Run `npm i`
1. In PowerShell, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to [allow .ps1 scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68505597/)
1. Run `npm run watch` to start compilation and auto-updates
1. Open Minecraft
1. Add this add-on to any world with `GameTest framework` experiment enabled

- Expected: Should say "Hello my first project!!!" (or whatever you replaced `__todo__` with)
